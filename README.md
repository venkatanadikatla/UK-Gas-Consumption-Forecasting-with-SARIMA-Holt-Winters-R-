# UK-Gas-Consumption-Forecasting-with-SARIMA-Holt-Winters-R-
Quarterly UK natural gas consumption (1960â€“1986) modeled with log transform + seasonal differencing, SARIMA identification via auto.arima, full residual diagnostics (ACF/PACF, Ljungâ€“Box), 16-quarter forecasts with back-transformation to original units, and a parallel Holt-Winters (additive) exponential smoothing fit with manual forecast checks.

## ðŸ”Ž Summary (TL;DR)
- **Data:** `UKgas` from base R datasets (quarterly, 1960â€“1986, 108 obs).
- **Preprocessing:** log transform; seasonal differencing (lag=4).
- **Stationarity:** ADF confirms stationarity after seasonal differencing (ct & c models).
- **Models:**  
  - SARIMA **ARIMA(2,0,3)(1,1,0)[4]** on log data.  
  - Holt-Winters additive (level, trend, seasonality) on log data.
- **Diagnostics:** Residuals ~ white noise; Ljungâ€“Box p â‰ˆ 0.19 (SARIMA), p â‰ˆ 0.21 (HW).
- **Forecasts:** 16 quarters ahead with 80/95% CIs; forecasts back-transformed (exp) to original units (millions of therms).
- **Extras:** Manual HW forecast checks reproduce `forecast()` outputs exactly.

## ðŸ§  Problem & Approach
**Goal:** Build interpretable seasonal forecasting models that (1) respect stationarity, (2) pass residual diagnostics, and (3) produce calibrated quarterly forecasts.

**Steps**
1. Explore raw series (trend + strong seasonality).  
2. **Transform:** `log(UKgas)`; **Seasonal difference:** `diff(., lag=4)`.  
3. **Stationarity tests:** ADF (`ct`, `c`, `nc`).  
4. **Identify orders:** ACF/PACF + `auto.arima()` (no drift/mean).  
5. **Fit:** SARIMA on log data; Holt-Winters on log data.  
6. **Validate:** Residual ACF/PACF, Q-Q, Ljungâ€“Box.  
7. **Forecast:** 16Q ahead; back-transform to original units.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results (selected)
- **SARIMA:** ARIMA(2,0,3)(1,1,0)[4] on log data; strong diagnostics (ACF residuals within bounds; Ljungâ€“Box pâ‰ˆ0.19).  
- **Holt-Winters:** Î±â‰ˆ0.029, Î²â‰ˆ1.0, Î³â‰ˆ0.725; seasonal indices consistent with winter peak (Q1), summer trough (Q3).  
- **Back-transformed forecasts:** e.g., 1987 Q1 â‰ˆ 1,244â€“1,263M therms depending on model; credible seasonal pattern sustained.
